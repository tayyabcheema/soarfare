Here's how I managed to visit 30 countries before turning 30, even with a global pandemic thrown into the mix.</p><h3>The Beginning</h3><p>It all started with a simple desire to see the world. I realized that if I wanted to travel extensively, I needed to start early and be strategic about it.</p><h3>Planning and Budgeting</h3><p>The key to extensive travel is smart budgeting. I learned to:</p><ul><li>Book flights well in advance</li><li>Travel during shoulder seasons</li><li>Use budget airlines for short-haul flights</li><li>Stay in hostels and budget accommodations</li><li>Eat like a local</li></ul><h3>The Pandemic Challenge</h3><p>When Covid-19 hit, I thought my goal was impossible. But I adapted by:</p><ul><li>Focusing on domestic travel when possible</li><li>Taking advantage of reduced flight prices</li><li>Planning future trips during lockdowns</li><li>Staying flexible with destinations</li></ul><h3>The Final Push</h3><p>Egypt was country number 30, and what a way to finish! The pyramids, the Nile, the incredible history – it was the perfect capstone to an amazing journey.</p><p>If you have travel goals, don't let obstacles stop you. Adapt, plan, and keep moving forward.

Here's why you should consider it for your next Italian adventure.</p><h3>Rich History and Architecture</h3><p>Verona is home to some of the best-preserved Roman architecture outside of Rome itself. The Arena di Verona, a Roman amphitheater built in 30 AD, still hosts world-class opera performances today.</p><h3>Romantic Atmosphere</h3><p>Beyond the Shakespeare connection, Verona exudes romance at every corner. From intimate wine bars to candlelit restaurants overlooking the Adige River, it's perfect for couples.</p><h3>Gateway to Northern Italy</h3><p>Verona's location makes it an excellent base for exploring:</p><ul><li>Lake Garda - Italy's largest lake</li><li>Venice - just 1.5 hours by train</li><li>Milan - perfect for shopping and fashion</li><li>The Dolomites - for outdoor adventures</li></ul><h3>Food and Wine</h3><p>The Veneto region is famous for its wines, particularly Amarone and Prosecco. Pair these with local specialties like risotto all'Amarone and you're in for a treat.</p><h3>Getting There</h3><p>Verona has its own airport with connections throughout Europe, or you can easily reach it by train from major Italian cities. The city center is compact and walkable, making it perfect for a long weekend getaway.</p><p>Book your flight to Italy today and discover the magic of Verona!</p>\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"title\": \"30 by 30\",\n                        \"image\": \"/destination4.jpg\",\n                        \"created_at\": \"2021-01-26T19:09:34.000000Z\",\n                        \"slug\": \"30-by-30\",\n                        \"content\": \"<p>My name is Chiara and I have a goal to visit 30 countries by my 30th year on earth!

Growing up in a small town, international travel seemed like something only wealthy people could afford. That all changed during my junior year of college when I studied abroad in Spain.</p><h3>The Spark</h3><p>That semester in Madrid opened my eyes to how much there was to see and experience in the world. I realized that with careful planning and budgeting, travel was much more accessible than I had thought.</p><h3>Setting the Goal</h3><p>On my 22nd birthday, I made a resolution: visit 30 countries before turning 30. At the time, I had only been to 3 countries, so this seemed like an enormous challenge.</p><h3>The Strategy</h3><p>To make this goal achievable, I developed a strategy:</p><ul><li><strong>Budget ruthlessly:</strong> I tracked every expense and cut unnecessary spending</li><li><strong>Travel smart:</strong> I learned to find deals, travel during off-peak times, and use budget accommodations</li><li><strong>Maximize trips:</strong> I planned routes that allowed me to visit multiple countries in one journey</li><li><strong>Work remotely:</strong> I negotiated remote work arrangements to extend my travels</li></ul><h3>The Countries</h3><p>Over the next 8 years, I explored:</p><ul><li>Europe: Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, and more</li><li>Asia: Thailand, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia</li><li>Americas: Mexico, Canada, Colombia, Peru, Chile</li><li>Africa: Morocco, Egypt, South Africa</li><li>Oceania: Australia, New Zealand</li></ul><h3>Lessons Learned</h3><p>This journey taught me that travel is about more than just checking countries off a list. It's about personal growth, cultural understanding, and creating lasting memories.</p><p>If you have a travel goal, start planning today.

They serve as constant reminders of where you've been and inspiration for where you want to go next.</p><h3>Classic Pin Maps</h3><p>The traditional pin map remains one of the most popular ways to

travel</li><li><strong>Detailed Versions:</strong> Some include cities, landmarks, and attractions</li></ul><h3>Digital Alternatives</h3><p>For tech-savvy travelers, digital options offer unique advantages:</p><ul><li><strong>Google My Maps:</strong> Create custom maps with photos and notes</li><li><strong>Travel Apps:</strong> Many apps automatically track and visualize your journeys</li><li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Share your adventures in real-time</li></ul><h3>Creative DIY Ideas</h3><p>Make your travel map uniquely yours:</p><ul><li><strong>Photo Collage Maps:</strong> Replace pins with photos from each destination</li><li><strong>Postcard Maps:</strong> Attach postcards from each place you visit</li><li><strong>Memory Maps:</strong> Add tickets, brochures, and other mementos</li></ul><h3>Planning Your Next Adventure</h3><p>Use your map not just to show where you've been, but to plan where you're going:</p><ul><li>Mark dream destinations with a different color</li><li>Research travel routes between planned destinations</li><li>Set annual goals for new places to add to your map</li></ul><h3>Making It Social</h3><p>Travel maps can bring people together:</p><ul><li>Create a family travel map for shared adventures</li><li>Compare maps with friends for travel inspiration</li><li>Use maps as conversation starters about your
